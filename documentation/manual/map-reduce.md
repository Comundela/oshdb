### hadoop remark

**Remark:** If you are already familiar with
[Hadoop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Hadoop),
note that we use the terminology of the
[Java stream API](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/package-summary.html)
which is slightly different. In particular, the Java stream API and
Hadoop use the same term 'combiner' for different things.
